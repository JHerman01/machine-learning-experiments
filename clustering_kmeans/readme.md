Clustering via k-means

Program generates a video cycling through the plots.

Some simple code for sorting a list and generating the videos was borrowed from stack overflow. The scripts contain comments crediting the authors.

PCA library from sklearn was used to reduce dimensionality. I used this instead of my own to ensure proper dimensionality reduction.

To run the script you must install the necessary libraries and simply run "python3 clustering.py".
